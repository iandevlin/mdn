#Video Player with Captions

Previously we looked at how to [build a cross browser video player](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Apps/Build/Manipulating_media/cross_browser_video_player) using the Media and Fullscreen APIs, and also at how to [style the player](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Apps/Build/Manipulating_media/Video_player_styling_basics). This article will take the same player and look at how captions and/or subtitles could be added.

##HTML5 and Video Captions

First of all, [captions and subtitles are not the same thing](http://screenfont.ca/learn/), but for the purposes of this article we will refer to them as captions, as the content of the files that are used have more in common with that type of content.


##Modifications

This section summarises the modifications made to the previous article's code in order to facilitate the addition of subtitles to the video.
